# Obfuscrypt

UHH... this might be good, might not be good. 

Too bad im lazy. but check out kernel_patch on insta. if i decide to make devlog it will be there
but if i were you i wont expect anything from me..


right now python parser is semi functional

branch - pyparser_development

also i tried doing code equivalency test first. 
IDK , 

CODE ---> Abstract syntax tree ---> plotted in a multidimentional vector co-ordinate space as a trajectory ---> then compare the trajectory and the final co-ordinate (monte-calro) ---> evaluate probability of functional equivalency

branch - vectorize_poc

(this one might have a devlog @ kernel_patch if i deciede to do it)

right now i dont have an idea on how to deal with trajetory comparision. i do know that if you constrain the dimensions the trajectory would actually be meaningful and not just nonsense data

Too bad i have ADHD i can see it in my head, just cant build it

the code obfuscation part, i dont plan it to be a click a button and get a output kind of thing. 
its going to be a framework consisting of prebuilt and custom ways to obfuscate not only the code but also the logic behind it and still get the same output.
all of this will be integrated on a drag and drop UI ofc...


peace. this is the typa project you'll never get to see completed. like GTA 6.
